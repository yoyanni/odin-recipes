    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      All the world's great donuts are fried, except there are a few rare
      examples of when they're notâ€”and this incredibly delicious and
      easy-to-make apple cider donut is one notable exception. Since we're not
      going to fry these, not only are they easier, but they're way less messy.
      Less time cleaning up means more time eating donuts.

    <p>Recipe by Yanni Alevras</p>
    <h2>Ingredient</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups fresh apple cider</li>
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>3/4 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>3/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon fine salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1 pinch ground cardamom</li>
      <li>1 pinch freshly grated nutmeg</li>
      <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 cup packed brown sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 cup warm milk</li>
      <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, divided</li>
      <li>3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Toppings:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup white sugar, or as needed</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Butter two 6-cup
        donut pans.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour apple cider into a saucepan and place over medium heat. Bring to a
        simmer and let it cook, watching carefully, until the cider is reduced
        to 1/2 cup. If it reduces too much, add enough water to make 1/2 cup.
        Set aside until needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, 1 teaspoon cinnamon,
        cardamom, and nutmeg to a large bowl. Mix with a whisk until combined
        and set aside until needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk 1/2 cup white sugar, brown sugar, milk, 2 tablespoons melted
        butter, vanilla extract, and egg together in another bowl until
        combined. Add the apple cider reduction and the dry ingredients. Whisk
        together to form a slightly thick batter; do not overmix.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spoon or pipe the batter into the prepared donut pans, filling them
        about 3/4 of the way up.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the center of the preheated oven until the tops are lightly
        browned, and the donuts spring back slightly to the touch, 10 to 12
        minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes in the pans before removing to a sheet
        pan lined with a silicone baking mat. Cut out any donut holes as
        necessary.
      </li>
      <li>
        If desired, while still slightly warm, brush the donuts lightly with
        remaining melted butter. Mix 1 cup white sugar and 1 tablespoon cinnamon
        together for topping in a shallow dish; toss in donuts to coat. Let cool
        completely before serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
